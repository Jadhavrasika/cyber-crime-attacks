 # CYBERSECURITY   ATTACKS 
                                                 
## OBJECTIVES:
The primary objective is to present a clear and concise overview of cybersecurity attack data, likely for analysis and decision-making purposes. By visualizing key metrics, the dashboard aims to provide actionable insights for security teams to mitigate and prevent future attacks.
DASHBOARD OVERVIEW:
The dashboard presents a comprehensive view of cybersecurity attacks, categorized by attack type, severity, location, and time. It utilizes a variety of visualizations, including:
•	Geographic Map of India: Shows the distribution of attacks across different states in India.
•	Pie Chart: Displays the proportion of different attack types (DDoS, Intrusion, Malware).
•	Stacked Bar Chart: Illustrates the severity levels of attacks in different cities.
•	Line Chart: Shows the trend of attacks over the years (2020-2023).
•	Bar Chart: Presents the count of alerts by browser type (Mozilla, Opera).
•	Tables: Provide detailed information on malware indicators and actions taken.

## Key Components:
•	Interactive Map: Allows users to explore attack data by location.
•	Filters: Enable users to drill down into specific data subsets (e.g., state, city, traffic type, year).
•	Charts and Graphs: Visually represent key metrics and trends.
•	Tables: Provide detailed data for analysis.
•	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Though not explicitly labelled, the counts and percentages act as KPIs, highlighting the volume and distribution of attacks.
        
## Insights:
•	Dominant Attack Types: The pie chart reveals that DDoS and Intrusion attacks each make up 35% of the total, followed by Malware at 30%. This suggests a need for strong defence against these prevalent attack vectors.
•	Geographic Distribution: The map highlights that attacks are dispersed across India, with some states experiencing higher activity. This indicates a need for geographically targeted security measures.
•	Severity Levels: The stacked bar chart shows the severity of attacks in different cities. Analyzing this can help prioritize resources to the most affected areas.
•	Temporal Trends: The line chart indicates the trend of attacks over time. Analyzing the patterns and fluctuations can help anticipate future threats.
•	Browser-Specific Alerts: The bar chart shows the number of alerts associated with different browsers, suggesting potential vulnerabilities or usage patterns.
•	Malware Indicators: The table provides detailed information on specific malware indicators, enabling proactive threat detection and response.
•	Actions Taken: The table detailing actions taken (Logged, Ignored, Blocked) provides insights into the effectiveness of incident response procedures.

## CONCLUSION:
The dashboard provides a valuable tool for monitoring and analyzing cybersecurity attacks. By visualizing key data points and trends, it enables security teams to:
•	Gain a comprehensive understanding of the attack landscape.
•	Identify vulnerabilities and prioritize resources.
•	Develop effective mitigation and prevention strategies.
•	Improve incident response procedures.
